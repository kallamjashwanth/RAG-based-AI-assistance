RAG based AI assistance

Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system over an AI research papers dataset.
The system retrieves relevant documents using hybrid search (BM25 + vector similarity) and generates a natural-language answer grounded in the retrieved documents.
A Streamlit web interface is provided for interactive querying.
